In this podcast, journalist Jason Lamphier (Entertainment Weekly) looks back at the major hits, one-hit wonders, shocking headlines, and irresistible scandals that shaped what might be the wildest, weirdest, most controversial 12 months in music history.\n\nFeaturing interviews with music video directors, MTV bigwigs, obsessive superfans, and special guests like Sir Mix-a-Lot, Ice-T, Tori Amos, and Vanessa Williams, Where Were You in '92? poses the question: What was it about 1992 that made it so groundbreaking, so bonkers, and so absolutely fabulous?"

In each episode, she sits down with some of today’s leading artists, authors, activists, and progressive thinkers who stand up, stick up and speak up for important causes. Inspired by the artist, Kandinsky, when he said that periods during which art has no noble champions are ones of retrogression, these intimate no-holds-barred roundtable conversations where ideas and experiences are exchanged, are where Santi and her fellow champions try to make some sense out of our world, to push culture forward. Boundary-expanding and defiantly vulnerable, Noble Champions is a public invitation to an intimate gathering of the minds."

The Gangster Chronicles is a weekly long form conversation with everyone from gangsters, police and bank robbers, to rappers, politicians and former d boys. The Gangster Chronicles gives you a glimpse into the world of those that live their lives outside of society's normal parameters, where the risk are high, but the rewards are astronomical. We conversate with the real Tony Montana's of the world, but we don't glorify or sensationalize these lifestyles, we simply examine the circumstances that may have influenced their decisions. Every gangster has a story and they all have a different ending.

This podcast is an evolution of my ongoing series of \"How It Was Made\" blog posts, in which I dissect and explain how my songs take shape, one song at a time. In this podcast, I'll be talking about my creative process, the intention and thought behind my songs - what they mean to me and why I did what I did. I'll also debut some new songs on here! That's the plan, but I'm brand new to this whole Podcast planet, so who knows! In any case, if you're curious about how my music gets made, I'd be so honored for you to take a listen. Love, Ryan"

I shall answer questions and seek knowledge from other music makers on a quest to discover how to make things sound RIGHT. I will also share some studio trickery on each episode as I explore some of my favourite innovations in music tech and my creations... outpourings from the weirdo brain!
